 *(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
 *LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
 *RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
 *FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table
